Functions to process data:

1. From the full library of 6-hour reanalysis and daily rainfall data which has been downloaded, sub-set the data over a region of interest and save this (along with climatology and anomalies) to file for easy retrieval later. 
2. From the 850 hPa streamfunction data, compute weather types (function is implemented in `paraguayfloodspy`).
