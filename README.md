## Installing Dependencies

All codes are written in python.
In addition to several standard packages used, we provide a custom package just for this paper, available [on github](github.com/jdossgollin/paraguayfloodspy).
This helps us separate the computation from the analysis.

    To get started use `git clone` or download the package as a `.zip` and unzip it.

Installing all required packages is easiest using `miniconda`:

```
conda env create --file environment.yml
source activate pyfloods
```
