\begin{block}{Conditional Simulation}
  Goal: condition the RIP events (poorly represented in CM3) on EWD and MHC indices (better represented in CM3).
  Assume:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Linear model for EWD and MHC indices
    \item MHC is secondary: if $\text{EWD}<0$, do not consider MHC
    \item Logistic regression model: $p(\text{RIP}_t) \sim f \qty(\text{EWD}_t, \text{MHC}_t)$
    \item Fit model on reanalysis temperature and pressure fields, and observed RIP events
    \item Simulate from model using CM3 temperature and pressure fields
  \end{itemize}
  \textbf{Comparing \cref{fig:historical-simulations} with \cref{fig:RIP-historic}, we see a marked improvement in model skill by conditioning on large-scale circulation features}
