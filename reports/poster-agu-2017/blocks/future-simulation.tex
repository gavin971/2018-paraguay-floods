\begin{block}{Future Simulations}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item A conditional simulation model using GCM atmospheric circulation and temperature projections for 21st century shows increasing trends for such events and
    \item Conditional simulation model attributes increasing RIP events approximately 1/3 to circulation changes and 2/3 to temperature changes
    \item Results differ signicantly from RIP events based only on MAM precipitation field
  \end{itemize}
