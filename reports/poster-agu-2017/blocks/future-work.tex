  \begin{itemize}
    \item Increase complexity of statistical model
    \item Sub-seasonal to seasonal predictors of RIP activity (\ie PNA)
    \item Assess other models
  \end{itemize}
  This \emph{framework for conditional simulation} is a robust alternative to grid-scale statistical downscaling
