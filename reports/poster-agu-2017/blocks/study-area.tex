\begin{block}{Lower Paraguay River Basin}
  Flat topography limits the river's ability to carry the summer runoff, causing seasonal inundation of the Pantanal and distributing the river discharge in time \cite{Bravo:2011et,Barros:2004bn}.
  The river is thus far more sensitive to persistent rainfall than individual storm events.
  During NDJF 2015-16, river stage [height] throughout the Lower Paraguay River Basin reached nearly three times climatological levels (not shown).
