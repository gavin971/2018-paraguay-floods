    \gls{wt} 1 occurs more frequently during El Ni\~{n}o years for most \gls{mjo} phases, particularly during phase 2.
    During El Ni\~no years, \gls{wt} 3 - associated with dryness over the \gls{lprb} - occurs less frequently during \gls{mjo} phases 4, 6, and 7, and more often during \gls{mjo} phase 8; this is consistent with the lack of \gls{wt} 3 during December 2015 and the frequent \gls{wt} 3 occurrence in mid-January 2016 (\cref{fig:fig:rain-wtype}).
