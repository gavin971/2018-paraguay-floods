    Flat topography limits the riverâ€™s ability to carry the summer runoff, causing seasonal inundation of the Pantanal and distributing the river discharge in time~\cite{Barros:2004wg, Bravo:2012iq}.
    During NDJF 2015-16, river stage [height] throughout the Lower Paraguay River Basin reached nearly three times climatological levels (not shown).
