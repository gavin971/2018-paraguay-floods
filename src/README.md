# Source Code

The code is all written in python.
The `pyfloods` directory provides a module in which most of the computation and definitions are carried out.
The rest of the analysis is implemented in `jupyter notebook` format.
Notebooks are numbered in a "smart" format as follows:

- `0X-xx.ipynb`: access the project's data
- `1X-xx.ipynb`: make plots that don't require substantial analysis
- `2X-xx.ipynb`: make plots associated with NDJF 2015-16 circulation and circulation anomalies
- `3X-xx.ipynb`: make plots associated with weather types
- `4X-xx.ipynb`: make plots associated with forecasts and forecast skill
